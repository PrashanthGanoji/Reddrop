# Reddrop
Reddrop is a place where people can find the blood donors based on blood-type and location(cities in india only)

This application is built using Python (Django with Django Rest Framework) as a backend and React as a Front end.

People can register as blood donors, find blood donor, The app allows to directly contact the donor throung a phone call.
Exisiting users can login and edit their information(eg. changing phone no. or location). If a donor recently donated blood he/she
can also set a special status flag to in-active so that he/she won't be visible in the search results and the status is automatically
set to active after three months.
